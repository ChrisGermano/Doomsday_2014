Love Platypus' game for Global Game Jam 2014, "Doomsday"

"Doomsday" is an experimental first-person puzzle game where the player assumes the role
of a sidewalk preacher trying to convince strangers that the end of the world is coming.
The player must target unconvinced people and try to figure out "what makes them tick", or
in other words a secret three-digit code made of 1's 2's and 3's. If they can accurately
guess enough of the code they convert the person to a follower, and continue trying to 
convert enough followers before time runs out. If they're successful, the world ends in a
crimson apocalypse, but if they fail to convert enough people the city is bathed in a
heavenly light, indicating doomsday has been avoided. Which approach will you take?
